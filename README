I wanted to add a thermocouple to the Creality K1C and this is the method that worked. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since Creality K1, K1C and Max printers use CrealityOS which is an older klipper fork I had to make software modifications to make this work.
I want to add that this method is untested on the K1 and Max printers, but I am pretty sure it would work too with some thinkering if not out of the box.

I used temperature host as the defined temperature sensor, but it's not directly supported by the CrealityOS, so I had to grab some files from the mainline klipper, paste them, write a bridge script and config the printer.cfg file to work.
The python script takes the serial data and writes it onto a file on the ram, so it doesn't damage the storage from continous read writes. I think it could cause thermal runaway if the arduino doesn't respond, but I've yet to test it.
You'll need an arduino nano as a bridge and a MAX31856 module that supports thermocouples.

The temperature bridge script was created with ChatGPT since I know just barely enough python to find and correct it's mistakes so feel free to make new versions should you feel like it. I'm currently in the process of testing this, so there's no guarantee
that anything will work. If you use this somewhere maybe you could credit me shomewhere, but the mod is free to use for everyone. :)


/// Here's how: ///

1. Grab an arduino and upload the max31856_Arduino_Serial_Script.ino, check if data is coming through the serial monitor. It should display something like: T:20.15.
  (For wiring check pins in the program btw)

2. Now get the:

-  arduino_max_bridge.py (must be from here)
-  temperature_host.py (can be ripped from klipper mainline, but I included the used version)
-  temperature_sensors.cfg (can be ripped from klipper mainline, but I included the used version)

and put it under /usr/data/klipper/klippy/extras/ on your machine using SSH. (I recommend MobaXTerm for doing stuff like this.)

!!! I'm still working on a method to auto-run this thing. !!!
The current command to run is: python3 "/usr/data/arduino_max_bridge.py"



3. Then edit printer.cfg on your machine and add this to your config:


/////

max_temp: 500

/////

Some parts should be already there, you can delete and paste this into it, but you can just add what's missing and set it to your own liking. 
Hopefully now it should throw out no errors and you'll be able to use your thermocouple for the extruder.
